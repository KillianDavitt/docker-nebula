<h1 id="deploying-your-containers-to-docker">5 Deploying your containers to Docker</h1>
<p>Now that we have a Docker based development workflow in place, and Docker hosts deployed in the SCSSNebula cloud, the final step is to automate the deployment of your docker containers to our cloud instances.</p>
<p>When you execute a command such as <code>docker run hello-world</code>, docker retrieves the container image from a docker registry, the default registry being <em>Docker Hub</em>. To deploy your projects as containers run in the same way, you must first create the image, register the image with a registry of your choice, and then execute the appropriate <code>docker run your-project-container</code> command to install and launch that container on the docker host.</p>
<p>You will recall that we added docker support to our Yesod projects by modifying the <code>stack.yaml</code> file. This caused our project to be built and executed within a docker container. To generate a Yesod docker container image that we can deploy to our docker hosts, add the following to your projectâ€™s <code>stack.yaml</code> file.</p>
<pre><code># Generate a Docker image
image:
  container:
    # New image will be called registry-account-name/myapp - adjust as required for your registry (see step 3)
    name: your registry-account-name/myapp
    # Base it on the stack-run images
    base: fpco/stack-run
    # Include some config and static files in the image
    add:
      config: /app/config
      static: /app/static</code></pre>
<p>With this in place, you can generate a container image by running <code>stack image container</code> on the command line in the project home directory. Once you have an image you can push it to a registry. There are two basic choices. You can push to <em>Docker Hub</em> or a similar third party registry, or you can create your own registry. We examine each case in turn.</p>
<h2 id="using-dockerhub">Using DockerHub</h2>
<p>Go to <a href="http://dockerhub.com">Docker Hub</a> and create an account, or alternatively go to some other Docker compatible registry service and create an account.</p>
<p>With an account created, you can now push that image to a docker registry using standard docker commands. Note that you can name your image as you like, so long as the name matches the appropriate pattern for your registry. So, for <em>Docker Hub</em>, the name should match the pattern <code>registry-account-name/image-name</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ docker push registry-account-name/myapp  # modify push parameter as approptiate</code></pre>
<p>To run the image on a docker host, login to the host of initialise your docker client with environment variables appropriately, and type:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker run registry-account-name/myapp</code></pre>
<p>That is all there is to it if you are happy to use <em>Docker Hub</em>, or an equivalent registry service.</p>
